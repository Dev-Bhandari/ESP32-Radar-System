## Description

The ESP32 Radar System is an open-source project designed to create a radar system using the ESP32 microcontroller. This project utilizes ultrasonic technology to detect and visualize objects in the proximity of the device. Additionally, the ESP32 hosts a web server to display radar information accessible over the internet.

## Features

- **Radar Detection:** Utilizes radar technology to detect objects.
- **ESP32 Integration:** Utilizes ESP32 microcontroller for control and data processing.
- **Web Interface:** Hosts a web server to display radar information accessible over the internet.
- **Visualization:** Provides visualization of detected objects on a web browser interface.
- **Customization:** Easily customizable for specific applications and requirements.
- **Open Source:** Available for free, open to contributions, modifications, and improvements.

## Requirements

- ESP32 microcontroller
- Ultrasonic sensor
- Servo motor

## Installation

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/Dev-Bhandari/ESP32-Radar-System.git`
2. Open the project in Arduino IDE.
3. Upload the code to your ESP32 device.

## Usage

1. Connect the radar sensor to the ESP32 according to the provided schematics or pin configurations in the code.
2. Upload the code to the ESP32.
3. Power on the device.
4. Create a hotspot network named "Dev" with the password "12345678", ESP32 will automatically connect to it.
5. Connect your device (e.g., laptop, smartphone) to the "Dev" hotspot network.
6. Once connected, open a web browser and enter the IP address of ESP32 to access the web interface.
